### Airbnb Homepage Replica Project
Welcome to my Airbnb Homepage Replica project! This task was assigned to me as a pre-bootcamp warm-up exercise by School of Code, aimed at honing my HTML, CSS, command line, and Git skills. 

## Objective 
My mission is to replicate the mobile version of the Airbnb homepage. This project not only tests my technical prowess but also emphasizes effective planning, task breakdown, and code review. I will also use the Chrome Debugger during this build in order to inspect the webpage's elements.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a testament to my ability to tackle real-world tasks with precision and proficiency. Beyond replicating a webpage, it showcases my problem-solving skills and dedication to continuous improvement.
